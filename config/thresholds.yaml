# Safety thresholds for freediving conditions assessment
# Lower values are better for wind and waves
# Higher values are better for swell period

thresholds:
  # Wind speed in knots
  wind_speed_kt:
    safe: 10        # <10kt: calm, ideal conditions
    caution: 15     # 10-15kt: manageable but choppy
    unsafe: 20      # >20kt: rough, not recommended

  # Significant wave height in meters
  wave_height_m:
    safe: 0.5       # <0.5m: flat, excellent
    caution: 1.0    # 0.5-1.0m: moderate, acceptable
    unsafe: 1.5     # >1.5m: rough, unsafe

  # Swell period in seconds (higher = better organized swells)
  swell_period_s:
    safe: 10        # >10s: long period, smooth
    caution: 7      # 7-10s: moderate
    unsafe: 5       # <5s: short choppy swells

  # Swell height in meters
  swell_height_m:
    safe: 1.0       # <1.0m: minimal swell
    caution: 1.5    # 1.0-1.5m: moderate swell
    unsafe: 2.0     # >2.0m: large swell

  # Wind gust in knots
  wind_gust_kt:
    safe: 15        # <15kt: minimal gusts
    caution: 20     # 15-20kt: moderate gusts
    unsafe: 25      # >25kt: strong gusts

# Visibility estimation parameters
visibility:
  turbidity_fnu:
    good: 2.0       # <2.0 FNU: clear water
    poor: 5.0       # >5.0 FNU: murky water

  rainfall_mm_3day:
    good: 10        # <10mm: minimal impact
    poor: 50        # >50mm: significant runoff

  wind_avg_kt_5day:
    good: 8         # <8kt: calm seas
    poor: 15        # >15kt: churned up sediment

# Notes:
# - These thresholds are conservative for freediving safety
# - Adjust based on your experience level and comfort
# - Consider combining multiple factors (e.g., high wind + high waves = worse)
